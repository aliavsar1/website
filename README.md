# website
I am a self-taught fullstack developer and currently I am working hard to learn all the subtleties of building a website, both frontend and backend. This repository
shows the work I am doing now. By the way, I started  roughly one year ago, in February 2022. I am working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJs. I am also working to learn
git and github. I am also planning to learn React and VueJs.
